Installation and source 
=========================

**Spectrum** is available on `PYPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, so you should be able to type::

    easy_install -U spectrum 


Since spectrum depends on other python packages such as Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy they will be installed automatically (if not already installed). 

You can also install them yourself by typing::

    easy_install -U numpy
    easy_install -U matplotlib
    easy_install -U scipy


.. note:: the -U option updates the libraries that are already installed.


**Spectrum** source code (SVN repository) is available here:

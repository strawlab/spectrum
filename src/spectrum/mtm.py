"""Multitapering method.

This module provides a multi-tapering method for spectral estimation. 
The computation of the tapering windows being computationally expensive, a C 
module is used to compute the tapering window (see :func:`spectrum.mtm.dpss`). 

The estimation itself can be performed with the :func:`spectrum.mtm.pmtm` function

    Usually in spectral estimation the mean to reduce bias is to use tapering window. 
    In order to reduce variance we need to average different spectrum. The problem 
    is that we have only one set of data. Thus we need to decompose a set into several 
    segments. Such method are well-known: simple daniell's periodogram, Welch's method
    and so on. The drawback of such methods is a loss of resolution since the segments 
    used to compute the spectrum are smaller than the data set. 
    The interest of multitapering method is to keep a good resolution while reducing 
    bias and variance. 

    How does it work? First we compute different simple periodogram with the whole data 
    set (to keep good resolution) but each periodgram is computed with a different 
    tapering windows. Then, we average all these spectrum. To avoid redundancy and bias
    due to the tapers mtm use special tapers.

    Calculation of the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences also known as the
    slepian sequences, and the corresponding eigenvalues. 

    :param int N: desired window length
    :param float NW: The time half bandwidth parameter (typical values are 2.5,3,3.5,4). 
    :param int k: returns the first k Slepian sequences. If *k* is not provided, *k* is set to *NW*2*.
    :return:
        * tapers, a matrix of tapering windows. Matrix is a N by *k* (k is the number of windows)
        * eigen, a vector of eigenvalues of length *k*

    The discrete prolate spheroidal or Slepian sequences derive from the following 
    time-frequency concentration problem. For all finite-energy sequences index 
    limited to some set , which sequence maximizes the following ratio:

    .. math::

        \lambda = \frac{\int_{-W}^{W}\left| X(f) \right|^2 df} 
            {\int_{-F_s/2}^{F_s/2}\left| X(f) \right|^2 df}
   
    where :math:`F_s` is the sampling frequency and :math:`|W| < F_s/2`. 
    This ratio determines which index-limited sequence has the largest proportion of its 
    energy in the band :math:`[-W,W]` with :math:`0  < \lambda < 1`. 
    The sequence maximizing the ratio is the first 
    discrete prolate spheroidal or Slepian sequence. The second Slepian sequence  
    maximizes the ratio and is orthogonal to the first Slepian sequence. The third 
    Slepian sequence maximizes the ratio of integrals and is orthogonal to both 
    the first and second Slepian sequences and so on.

    .. note:: Note about the implementation. Since the slepian generation is computationally expensive, 
        we use a C implementation based on the C code written by Lees as published in:

            Lees, J. M. and J. Park (1995): Multiple-taper spectral analysis: A stand-alone 
            C-subroutine: Computers & Geology: 21, 199-236.

        However, the original C code has been trimmed. Indeed, we only require the multitap 
        function (that depends on jtridib, jtinvit functions only).
